# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. This project demonstrates basic JavaScript skills, DOM manipulation, and user interaction.

## Features

- Play a classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- User-friendly interface for selecting your choice.
- Dynamic score tracking to show the user's and computer's scores.
- A reset option to start a new game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the basic structure of the game.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For game logic and interactivity.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser (link or file path).
2. Choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by clicking the corresponding button.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move.
4. The winner of each round is displayed, along with updated scores.
5. Play until you want to reset the game and start over.
